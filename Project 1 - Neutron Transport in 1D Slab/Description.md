This document presents the implementation and results of a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) model developed to predict the position-dependent neutron flux $\phi(x)$ in a one-dimensional slab with vacuum boundary conditions. The project first formulates and solves the $S_N$ neutron transport equation using the diamond-difference method to generate reference data. Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) are then used to create 150 training and 20 test source distributions $Q(x)$, from which corresponding flux profiles are computed. The DeepONet, trained using the DeepXDE framework, successfully learns the nonlinear mapping $Q(x) \rightarrow \phi(x)$, achieving a mean relative $L_2$ error below 0.004 on unseen test data â€” demonstrating its effectiveness as a surrogate model for neutron transport simulations.

### üß© Overview

This project develops a **DeepONet-based surrogate model** for solving the **1D steady-state neutron transport equation** under **vacuum boundary conditions**.  
The goal is to learn a mapping from the **source distribution** $Q(x)$ to the corresponding **neutron flux** $\phi(x)$ using operator learning.

We first solve the deterministic $S_N$ transport problem using transport sweep and source iteration technique. Then, we generate a dataset using **Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs)** for diverse source distributions, and finally train a **DeepONet** model to approximate the transport operator.

### üß† Methodology

1. **Transport Solver**
   - Implements 1D discrete ordinates ($S_N$) method.
   - Uses **diamond-difference scheme** for spatial discretization.
   - Vacuum boundaries at both ends of the slab.
   - Computes cell-averaged scalar flux:
     $\phi_j = \sum_n w_n \psi_{n,j}$

2. **Dataset Generation**
   - Generate 150 GRF-based source samples $Q_i(x)$ and compute corresponding fluxes $\phi_i(x)$ using the solver.
   - Each function is evaluated at 100 equally spaced spatial points.
   - Aligned dataset of shape `(n_samples, n_points)` is used.

3. **DeepONet Model**
   - **Branch network:** takes discretized source distribution $Q(x)$.
   - **Trunk network:** takes position coordinate $x$.
   - Combined through a dot product to predict $\phi(x)$.
   - Implemented with DeepXDE using the PyTorch backend.
